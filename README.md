## Preparing the project

1. Install dependencies with the `npm install` command.
2. Prepare create a `settings.json` file in the project root, following this structure:

```env
  API_PORT=8080
  MONGO_URI
```

3. Build the web service with the `npm run build` command.
4. Run migrations to ensure your database is up to date, using `npm run migrate`.
5. If you wish to insert test data, use the `npm run seed` command.

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

### Running in Docker

1. Run the `npm run build:docker` command to build the docker container.
2. Run the `npm run start:docker` command to compose and start.

In the case of port conflicts, review/edit the `docker-compose.yml` file accordingly.
The docker container is built with seeding for demo purposes. If desired this can be removed from the `Dockerfile`.

Once the app is running, swagger documentation can be found at the /api route.
eg. if you are running the web service locally, navigate to http://localhost:8080/api
